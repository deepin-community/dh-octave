=head1 NAME

dh_octave_make - generate a Debian package from the sources of an Octave-Forge package

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_octave_make>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dh_octave_make> is a helper script for generating a first
version of a Debian package for an Octave-Forge package. The command should
be launched from the top directory of the unpacked sources of an
Octave-Forge package.  A file called F<DESCRIPTION> must be present, from
which information about the package is gathered.  The following files
are generated with sensible contents, although they need further editing:

=over

=item debian/changelog

=item debian/control

=item debian/copyright

=item debian/rules

=item debian/source/format

=item debian/upstream/metadata

=item debian/watch

=item deabin/gbp.conf

=back

The files above are only created if they do not exist yet.  This allows
the use of B<dh_octave_make> for updating an already
debianized source tree.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The environment variables B<DEBFULLNAME> and B<DEBEMAIL> are used for
generating the identity of the developer, which will appear in
F<debian/changelog> and F<debian/copyright>. If they do not exist, B<FULLNAME>
and B<EMAIL> are used instead.

=head1 DISCLAIMER

B<dh_octave_make> is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but B<without any warranty>; without even the implied warranty of
B<merchantability> or B<fitness for a particular purpose>.

### Get program name
(my $prog = $0) =~ s|.*/||;

### Function for yelling on errrors
sub croak ($) {
    my $message = shift;
    die "$prog:E: $message\n"
}

### The pkgdata hash will store the data in the DESCRIPTION file
my %pkgdata;

### Function for creating a directory if it does not exist yet
sub makedir ($) {
    my $dir = shift;
    -d $dir or mkdir $dir;
}

### Function for opening a file and adding content to it
sub writefile ($$$) {
    my $mode = shift;
    my $file = shift;
    return if mode != "<<" and -e $file;
    my $content = shift;
    open (FID, $mode, $file);
    print FID $content;
    close FID;
}

### Check whether a given field exists in the DESCRIPTION file and exit the
### program with an error message, in the case the field does not exist
sub check ($) {
    my $field = shift;
    exists $pkgdata{$field} or croak "$field not found in DESCRIPTION";
}

### File DESCRIPTION is not present.  Yell loudly.
-f "DESCRIPTION" or croak "File DESCRIPTION not found";

### Read the fields present in the DESCRIPTION file
open (FID, "< DESCRIPTION");

check ("Title");

check ("Maintainer");

### directory, which typically contains C++ files to be compiled.
